              <h2><strong>WHAT COMPRISES THE ATIVAN ADDICT?</strong></h2>
              <p>Experts suggest there are two types of users who succumb to <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> addiction. They are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The active recipient of Ativan. This person legally obtains Ativan through a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, yet due to long-term use, has become addicted to the <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/benzodiazepines-anti-anxiety-addiction-rolled-one">benzodiazepine</a>-class drug.</li>
                <li>The recreational recipient of Ativan, who through continuous use of the drug, has needed to increase its dosage to get the same level of high.              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The usual methods of obtaining Ativan are no different from other prescription narcotics or opioids. They are either legally prescribed and bought through a pharmacy, or obtained through illegal drug sales and/or theft.</p>
              <p>In the realm of theft, Ativan is usually stolen from a family member who already uses the drug, or in other cases, extended family members as well as friends.              </p>
              <h2><strong>WHAT DOES ATIVAN DO FOR A USER OF THE DRUG?</strong></h2>
              <p>Ativan is an anti-anxiety drug. Once taken, the drug provides a calming, euphoric feeling. Muscle relaxation and drowsiness can also occur from Ativan.</p>
              <p>Of course, due to the relaxation and sensations of drowsiness given off by Ativan, the drug can be very dangerous when operating machinery, or in situations in which alertness and clear-minded decisions are needed.</p>
              <p>Combining Ativan with other drugs causes an even more intense &ldquo;high&rdquo; than if taken alone. However, at the same time, Ativan is clinically combined with other medications to counteract their effects.  Some of the more typical drugs Ativan are combined with include:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/cocaine-uses-abuses">Cocaine&nbsp;</a>— Ativan can counteract the      stimulant effects of cocaine, helping users come down from the high.</li>
                <li>Amphetamines&nbsp;— Amphetamines      are &ldquo;uppers&rdquo; like cocaine, so Ativan may be used alongside them for the      same reason.</li>
                <li>Methadone&nbsp;— Many people      will take Ativan to boost the effects of the painkiller methadone.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/alcohol-everywhere-legal-drug">Alcohol&nbsp;</a>— When combined, Ativan and      alcohol produce a quick, potent high. Mixing the two increases central      nervous system depression, which can lead to over-sedation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Taking Ativan in combination with other drugs is very dangerous as it increases the risk of overdose. In some cases, excessive sedation from mixing drugs can lead to unconsciousness, coma or death.              </p>
              <h2><strong>HOW DOES ATIVAN WORK?</strong></h2>
              <p>Ativan helps balance chemicals in the brain that can cause anxiety. When taken in especially large doses, Ativan binds to special receptors in the brain to produce a fleeting, intense high, followed by a prolonged state of calm.&nbsp;              </p>
              <h2><strong>HOW DO I KNOW WHEN A LOVED ONE OR FRIEND HAS OVERDOSED ON ATIVAN?</strong></h2>
              <p>Because Ativan is very potent and can seem harmless as a prescription drug, it is a prime candidate for both accidental and intentional abuse, as well as accidental overdose. Most commonly, overdoses occur when Ativan is taken in combination with alcohol or other drugs.<br>
                Signs of an Ativan overdose can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mental confusion</li>
                <li>Slurred speech</li>
                <li>Lack of energy</li>
                <li>Loss of control of body movements</li>
                <li>Muscle weakness</li>
                <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                <li>Slow breathing</li>
                <li>Coma              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>HOW CAN I HELP THE ATIVAN ADDICT IN MY LIFE?</strong></h2>
              <p>If you know someone who has an Ativan addiction, help him or her find a legitimate and <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/">accredited detox and recovery center</a> that offers both in and outpatient services and 24-7 help, guidance and support.</p>
